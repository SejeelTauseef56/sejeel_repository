  description: `Hi, I’m Sejeel Tauseef, a Software Developer specialising in PHP and Laravel, focused on building scalable and high-performance web applications.

I work across the full stack using technologies such as Vue.js, React, Next.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Docker. I also build custom WordPress solutions using Bricks Builder and Elementor, including landing pages and organic site improvements.

My role includes developing CRM features, automations, API integrations, and performance improvements, alongside creating new landing pages and enhancing the overall web presence.

I’m passionate about clean code, modern DevOps practices, and creating reliable digital experiences. Always open to collaborating on exciting projects.`,
